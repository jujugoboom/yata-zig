# yata-zig

Basic YATA implementation in Zig. Currently supports strings and basic diff resolution.

Heavy inspiration from [Bartosz Sypytkowski](https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/yata/) and [yjs](https://yjs.dev/)

Somewhat dumping ground for playing with zig for now. Will maybe cleanup in the future.

The protocol utilized here is not compatible wtih other y-protocol implementations, it may be one day, but the underlying structs can be utilized for string CRDTs.
